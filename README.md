#Enterprise RAG Platform

A production-grade, multi-tenant Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) platform built with FastAPI, PostgreSQL, PGVector, LLM orchestration, and a modular architecture that mirrors how real companies build AI platforms.

🚀 Features (MVP)

Multi-tenant knowledge bases
Document ingestion (PDF, DOCX, text, HTML)
Text extraction, cleaning, chunking
Embeddings (local or cloud)
Vector search using PGVector
RAG query endpoint (/rag/query)
JWT-based tenant-aware auth
Logging & metrics
Deployable via Docker, Render, Fly.io

🏁 Getting Started (local)

- Install Python 3.11+.  
- Install deps: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (set `PYTHONPATH=backend` when running locally).  
- Run API: `uvicorn app.main:app --app-dir backend --reload`.  
- Or via Docker Compose: `docker-compose up --build` (starts Postgres+PGVector and the API).

🧱 Tech Stack

📌 Goal

To build and ship a real-world enterprise-grade RAG service end-to-end as part of a portfolio and practical learning project.
